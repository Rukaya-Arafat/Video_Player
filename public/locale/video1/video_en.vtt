00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You are rewarded for your striving.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
All your days pass with hope

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
that God will bring about a miracle

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
that will change your situation.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
You are rewarded for your silence.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
You are rewarded for your trust in God.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Because despite all your pain—

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
the pain no one knows about except you,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
the pain you have not yet overcome—

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
you still trust that God is more merciful to you
than His servants are.
