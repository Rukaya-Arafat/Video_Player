00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Qur’an shows us that the people of Paradise are of two types.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The righteous who are moderate,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and those who are foremost and close to God.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first rank is attained through justice;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
by fulfilling obligations and avoiding prohibitions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The second rank is attained only through grace;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
by fulfilling obligations and voluntary acts,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and avoiding prohibitions and disliked matters.
